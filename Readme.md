Splash Screen React-Native App
A basic project for my own in which I have created a Splash Screen for
demo React-Native app.

Prerequisites:
Only for android users.

react-native init SplashScreen
yarn add react-native-splash-screen@3.0.6

Most of the changes are in android sdk folder. So, for creating a Splash
Screen in android you have to see some changes which I have done in that.

Errors which halts you:

1. If latest version, react-native does not support with your system like
Windows, paste this line: react-native init --version="0.55.4" SplashScreen
2. Then, check that your API should match up with the project, so there
shouldn't be any typo.
3. Install yarn by searching on google.

Expected Output:
